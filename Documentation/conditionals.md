# Control-flow
The three types of control statements of supported control flow should be if and else statements as well as switch statements. Else-if statements will just be if statements contained in and else statement.
## If
```
if (conditional) {
   code that executes if traditional is true
}
```
## Else
```
if (conditional) {
   code that executes if conditional is true
} else {
   code that executes if conditional is false
}
```
## Switch Statements
```
switch(thing to be evaluated){
    case(value match #1) {
        code that executes if thing to be evaluated matches value match #1
    }
    case(value match #2) {
        code that executes if thing to be evaluated matches value match #1
    }
    default {
        code that happens no matter what
    }
