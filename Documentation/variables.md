# Instantiation
Variables can be instantiated with their type then name
`int num`
or with their type, name and then initial value following the assignment operator `=`
`int num = 0`
Variables of the `any` type must be initialized, meaning this class is probably only helpful in function parameters.
# Final
The `final` keyword may be placed before the declaration of a variable to force that value to not ever be modifiable.
