# Enkelt
Making my own coding language for fun

# Purpose
Mostly this is just to make a language that conforms to my own preferences of how a programming language should work. In addition, I thought it might be nice to get a chance to make my own fun little compiler. 

The higher level focus of the language is to be as simple (like the name), dangerous, and fast as possible. I want it to be very keyword rich and to minimize diacritic-esque syntax. It should be simple.

### Tasking
- rework scanner to diferentiate between different keywords
- create corresponding tokens
- make filename pass in via commandline
- make commandline "-h" acceptable
- figure out how to implement the stupid parser

### To implement now
- functions
- variable assignment 
- some form of output/input
- loops

### To implement later:
- classes
- errors/handling
- datastructures
